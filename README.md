# Ideation and Problem-Solving Lab

It's time to come up with some great app ideas. These ideas can be just practice, or they can be the start of a new personal project, or they can be used for group projects, a hackathon, or an open source project.

A list of possible app ideas will be handy, so even if you have a great idea but can't use it right away, it can still be utilized later.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. When you read back the work, you've written things clearly so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

Answer the following questions for at least one idea:

- Which industry does this app belong to?

- Who is this product for (customer persona)

- What problem does it solve?

- Why is this problem important?

- What are the customers currently doing to solve the problem?

- How does it compare to the alternatives?

- What tasks does the app perform to solve the problem?

- What are the expected outcomes?

- Will this app be:
- A totally new idea (e.g., solves a problem for people living on Mars)
- An extension/new feature of an existing product/app (Uber does [last-mile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)>) deliveries for prescriptions)
- A new version of an app that already exists but is significantly different (compare/contrast MySpace to FaceBook)
- Other (make sure you can clearly explain if it is other)
